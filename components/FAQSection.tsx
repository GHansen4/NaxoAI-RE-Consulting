    question: "Do I need to know how to code?",
    answer: "No. I handle the setup; you just use the tools."
  },
  {
    question: "What tools do you use?",
    answer: "Whatever fits your workflowâ€”typically Calendly, Google apps, DocuSign/Dropbox, plus simple AI apps. No lock-in."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast will I see results?",
    answer: "Often within days. Listing copy, chatbots, and follow-ups can go live quickly."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from a marketing agency?",
    answer: "Agencies produce content. I install repeatable systems that reduce weekly admin work."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with teams or brokerages?",
    answer: "Yes. We can start with one agent and scale to the office."
  },
  {
    question: "What will I get from the free consultation?",
    answer: "A personalized AI action plan, a timeline, and recommended tools."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't know where to start?",
    answer: "Bring your biggest time drain. We'll find a quick win."
